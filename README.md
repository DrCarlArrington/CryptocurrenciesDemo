The objective of this challenge was to preprocess the crytpo data set using Pandas, reduce the dimensions to three principal components using PCA, 
predict clusters using the K-means algorithm, create an Elbow curve to find the best value for K, 
create a 3D-scatter plot using Plotly Express, create a 2D scatter plot using Holoviews, and a create table with tradable cryptocurrencies for the results.
